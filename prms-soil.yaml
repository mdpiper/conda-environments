# An env for testing PRMSSoil on Linux and macOS.
#
# Note the channel order: I'm using a one-off, between-release version
# of pymt deployed on the csdms-stack channel; therefore, this channel
# is listed before conda-forge. I also had to ensure, through
# versioning, that udunits, scripting, and model_metadata are pulled
# from conda-forge, not csdms-stack.
